# Inverted_Pendulum
Here is my take on an inverted pendulum robot made with arduino
The idea of the project is to keep the stick on top of the robot in balance.

The video shows that the robot balances the stick its connected to the robot using some LEGOs

In the first code "Inverted_pendulum.ino" the "car" goes as fast as it can as soon as the stick is tipping but with "Inverted_pendulum_with_acceleration.ino" the "car" accelerates judging how much the stick has tilted.

When i made the codes i found that the code without acceleration works better.
